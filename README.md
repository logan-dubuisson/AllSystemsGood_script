# AllSystemsGood_script
AllSystemsGood is a general purpose Space Engineers script designed to maximize automation of basic (and often tedious) tasks, such as power management, atmospheric breach closure, and more. The goal of this script is to provide Engineers with a higher degree of base autonomy with a simple implementation so they can focus on the important stuff (like not dying!).
